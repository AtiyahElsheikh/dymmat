The DYMola MATlab toolbox contains high level scripts for processing and manipulating Dymola simulations. It makes use of the matlab script files distributed with Dymola. 

A specific feature of the toolbox its capability to perform timed simulations, i.e. simulation that breaks after a specific time. This is particularly useful when performing optimization of large-scale simulations. In this case, it is possible that the optimizer jumps into infeasible regions w.r.t. the employed DAE solver making the simulation runtime infeasibly long and the optimization process completely unreliable.    

Not all code is provided here due to copyright issues. You need to contact me if you want to make use of the mentioned features.
